# Dr. John Snow's map of London's 1854 cholera epidemic
The primary goal of this project is to recreate Dr. John Snow's map of the cholera epidemic in London in 1854 and explain it using some interactive graphics. When anyone first made the connection between contaminated water and cholera, Dr. John Snow's map was considered to be a masterpiece. It is easy to see how these illuminating representations could be useful in identifying the underlying causes of issues. To develop the interactive version of the map for this project, I used D3, HTML, and CSS. The dataset is made up of four files that provide the coordinates of the streets and pumps where the deaths occur each day, representing attributes like their age and gender. Creating the wireframe with HTML and CSS turned out to be the most reasonable and iterative process because I decided to keep the interactions to a one-page dashboard. To add SVGs, I inserted id and class tags to each section after using CSS grid and flex.
