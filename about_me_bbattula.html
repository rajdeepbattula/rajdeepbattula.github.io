			I am Bala Akhil Rajdeep Battula. Currently a graduate student at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis majoring in applied data science.
          This project was completed as a component of the Visualization Design, Analysis, and Evaluation course.<br> <br>

          This project is a replication of the famous cholera map by John Snow, which played a key role in stopping the spread of
          cholera epidemic in Soho, London in 1854. This map helped in identifying that the major reason for the spread of cholera in London in 1854 is the
          pump located on the Broad street.

          <br>
          <h4>Visualization Details</h4>
          I have implemented this project using D3.js, HTML and CSS. Dataset consists of 4 files with informations like locations of streets, locations of pumps,
          number of deaths on each day and file with locations, age and gender of each death. User have the option to select to visualize deaths on map based on age and gender with the help of buttons.
          There is a timeline chart representing number of deaths on each day representing number of deaths by age group and gender.
          User have the option to hover on the timeline chart , so that deaths recorded on that day will be shown on the map. <br><br>
